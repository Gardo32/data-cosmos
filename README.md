# Biopixel - Satellite Vegetation Analysis Platform

![BioPixel Logo](static/logo.png)

## Overview

BioPixel is a powerful web-based platform for satellite vegetation analysis that helps users analyze, visualize, and extract agricultural insights from satellite imagery. The system leverages advanced image processing techniques, data visualization, and AI-powered analysis to provide actionable intelligence about vegetation coverage, agricultural potential, and environmental conditions.

## Docker Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Git to clone the repository

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-cosmos.git
cd data-cosmos
```

2. Create your environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration settings and API keys.

4. Build and start the Docker container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Access the application:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. You can customize these in your `.env` file:

- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask application secret key
- `FLASK_ENV`: Application environment (development/production)
- `FLASK_DEBUG`: Enable/disable debug mode (1/0)
- `PORT`: The port the application will run on

For a complete list of available environment variables, see the `.env.example` file.

### Data Persistence

The Docker setup mounts a volume at `./data` to persist uploaded files and analysis data between container restarts.
